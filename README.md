# secretSantaC

I started my Secret Santa project coding on C++ but decided to create a website instead. The idea of creating the website was better because my family could use it to draw the secret names anywhere and with any available platform that has a web browser.

This program works as intended, but it needs some improvements and ideas, which I encourage you to leave your feedback and improvement suggestions. Thank you!
